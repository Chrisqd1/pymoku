   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Moku:Lab Python Interface
=========================

pymoku is a Python library for the command, control and monitoring of Liquid Instruments
Moku:Lab devices.  This interface can suppliment or replace the default iPad interface,
allowing the Moku:Lab to be scripted tightly in to your next experiment.

.. warning:: This documents the 0.1 version of pymoku. The library is known to be incomplete
	and has several known issues. Not all functions documented here will necessarily work 
	as documented. Use at your own risk (but thank you in advance for your feedback!).

For example usage, see the individual instrument pages or the **examples/** subdirectory
of this project.
