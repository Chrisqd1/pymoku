# The following two example arrays are simple rectangular FIR kernels with 50 
# and 400 taps respectively. A rectangular kernel produces a sinc shaped 
# transfer function with width inversely proportional to the length of the 
# kernel. FIR kernels must have a normalised power of <= 1.0, so the value of 
# each tap is the inverse of the total number of taps.
filt_coeff1 = [1.0 / 50.0] * 50
filt_coeff2 = [1.0 / 400.0] * 400

# Connect to your Moku by its device name
# Alternatively, use Moku.get_by_serial('#####') or Moku('192.168.###.###')
m = Moku.get_by_name('Moku')
i = m.deploy_or_connect(FIRFilter)

try:
	# Configure the Moku:Lab's frontend settings
	i.set_frontend(1, fiftyr=True, atten=False, ac=False)
	i.set_frontend(2, fiftyr=True, atten=False, ac=False)

	# Load the coefficients for each FIR filter channel.
	#
	# The channel's decimation factor determines the filter sample rate (Fs) and 
	# the maximum number of filter kernel coefficients (N) for the channel.
	# The defining equations are given by:
	#
	#   3 <= decimation_factor <= 10,
	# 	Fs = 125 MHz / 2^decimation_factor,
	# 	N  = 2^(decimation_factor) * 29.
	#
	# To implement 50 FIR taps, N = 2^(3) * 29 = 232 > 50
	i.set_filter(1, decimation_factor=3, filter_coefficients=filt_coeff1)
	# To implement 400 FIR taps, N = 2^(4) * 29 = 464 > 400
	i.set_filter(2, decimation_factor=4, filter_coefficients=filt_coeff2)

	# Both channels have unity gain and no offsets
	i.set_gains_offsets(1, input_gain=1.0, output_gain=1.0, input_offset=0, 
		output_offset=0)
	i.set_gains_offsets(2, input_gain=1.0, output_gain=1.0, input_offset=0, 
		output_offset=0)

finally:
	m.close()
