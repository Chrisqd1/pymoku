from pymoku import Moku
from pymoku.instruments import ArbitraryWaveGen
import numpy as np

#generate a signal the the Arb Waveform Gen should generate on the output
t = np.linspace(0, 1, 100) # Evaluate our waveform at 100 points

# Simple square wave (can also use scipy.signal)
sq_wave = np.sign(np.sin(2 * np.pi * t))

# More interesting waveform. Note that we have to normalize this waveform
# to the range [-1, 1]
not_sq = np.zeros(len(t))
for h in np.arange(1, 15, 2):
    not_sq += (4 / (np.pi * h)) * np.cos(2 * np.pi * h * t)

not_sq = not_sq / max(not_sq)

# Connect to your Moku by its device name
# Alternatively, use Moku.get_by_serial('#####') or Moku('192.168.###.###')
m = Moku.get_by_name('Moku')

# Prepare the ArbitraryWaveGen instrument
i = ArbitraryWaveGen()
m.deploy_instrument(i)

try:
	# Load the waveforms to the device. This doesn't yet generate an output as we haven't
	# set the amplitude, frequency etc; this only defines the shape.
	i.write_lut(1, not_sq)
	i.write_lut(2, sq_wave)

	# We have configurable on-device linear interpolation between LUT points. Normally
	# interpolation is a good idea, but for sharp edges like square waves it will
	# improve jitter but reduce rise-time. Configure whatever's suitable for your application.
	i.gen_waveform(1, period=1e-6, amplitude=1, interpolation=True)
	i.gen_waveform(2, period=1e-6, amplitude=2, interpolation=False)
finally:
	m.close()
